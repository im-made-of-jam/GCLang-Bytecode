additional2 shall be the address of the instruction after the final ifEnd

an if without an else is essentially the same, but with no code after the ifElse label


upon encountering a loopBegin instruction:
    the current IP is pushed to the loopStack
    then the address of the related loopEnd instruction is pushed to the loopStack

upon encountering a loopEnd instruction:
    the loopStack is popped and the value discarded
    the IP is set to the value of the next pop, which is the address fo the related loopBegin instruction

upon encountering a loopBreak instruction:
    the IP is set to the value of the first pop
    the loopStack is then popped again but this time the value is discarded
